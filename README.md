# Introduction

HTML is the backbone of modern day front-end development. The language structure appears simple and scalable at first glance, however, this becomes less true with each module on a complex and growing page. Modern web and mobile applications have to deal with huge iterations of code cleaning and tag checking, and when a tag breaks, it can set back a team hours or maybe days behind. That is when iziTag comes in. The sole purpose of the iziTag programming language is to make front-end development a breeze through the use of intuitive and easy (hence ‘izi’) built in functions and data types. There is no need to worry about tags, as indents are easily to identify within the iziTag source code. Code generation and maintenance is reduced greatly and parameters are easily handled. 

# Welcome to the IziTag Project Page

The IziTag language was our project presented as a requisite for the ICOM 4036 Programming Languages course offered by professor Wilson Rivera at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus. The IziTag development team consist of Tahiri Funtes, Jean Rodriguez , Mark Suhkran and Jose Abreu.

The IziTag Programming Langueage, is a programming language designed to generate HTML pages with simple IzizTag functions. The syntax of IziTag is based on the Python language and uses the PyPeg library to define the rules of the language. Some of the functions include  iziTitle which makes a HTML Title , iziPar that generates a HTML paragraph and many other functions. As a result, we will include a tutorial and video on building simple web pages with iziTag.
